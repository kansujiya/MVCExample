Create an Application that load data from the Internet, the data is in JSON

format and it is array of dictionary. The dictionary has details such as title,

date, html, â€¦etc.

We need to create 2 views. The first one (ListView) is a list that show the item

title (ANNOUNCEMENT_TITLE) and date (ANNOUNCEMENT_DATE). When

I tap on one item, you push the second view (DetailsView) that has a webview

to load html (ANNOUNCEMENT_HTML) code.

Also, we need to create a model class (DataManager) that can do all the

network operation and notify the view using handlers.

- ListView:

- It has a ListView to show the list.

- Show ActivityIndicator View.

- Initiate data loading using the DataManger and provide the handler for it

to be get invoked once data finished load.

- Dismiss ActivityIndicator View.

- Bind the data to ListView cells.

- When user tap on the cell you push the DetailsView.

- DetailsView

- It has a Web View

- Bind the html code (ANNOUNCEMENT_HTML) received to it.

- DataManager Model Class

- It has one method &quot;loadData&quot; that has 2 parameter:

- url

- handler

- The DataManager create an async URL Request and load the data.

- On Finish Loading , you need to invoke the handler and pass the array list

after parsing the JSON data.
